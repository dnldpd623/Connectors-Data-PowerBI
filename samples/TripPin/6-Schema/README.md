# TripPin Part 6 - Schema
This multi-part tutorial covers the creation of a new data source extension for Power Query. The tutorial is meant to be done sequentially â€“ each lesson builds on the connector created in previous lessons, incrementally adding new capabilities to your connector. 

In this lesson, you will:

* Define a fixed schema for a Rest API
* Dynamically set data types for columns
* Enforce a table structure to avoid transformation errors due to missing columns
* Hide columns from the result set

Please follow the tutorial at Microsoft Docs for Power Query [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/samples/trippin/6-schema/readme).
