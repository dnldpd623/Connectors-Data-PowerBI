# TripPin Part 3 - Navigation Tables

This multi-part tutorial covers the creation of a new data source extension for Power Query. The tutorial is meant to be done sequentially - each lesson builds on the connector created in previous lessons, incrementally adding new capabilities to your connector. 

In this lesson, you will:

* Create a navigation table for a fixed set of queries
* Test the navigation table in Power BI Desktop

Please follow the tutorial at Microsoft Docs for Power Query [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/samples/trippin/3-navtables/readme).
