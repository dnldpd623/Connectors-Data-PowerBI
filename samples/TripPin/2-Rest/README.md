# TripPin Part 2 - Data Connector for a REST Service
This multi-part tutorial covers the creation of a new data source extension for Power Query. The tutorial is meant to be done sequentially -
each lesson builds on the connector created in previous lessons, incrementally adding new capabilities to your connector. 

In this lesson, you will:

* Create a base function that calls out to a REST API using [Web.Contents](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt260892.aspx)
* Learn how to set request headers and process a JSON response
* Use Power BI Desktop to wrangle the response into a user friend format

Please follow the tutorial at Microsoft Docs for Power Query [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/samples/trippin/2-rest/readme).
