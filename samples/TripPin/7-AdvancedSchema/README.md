# TripPin Part 7 - Advanced Schema
This multi-part tutorial covers the creation of a new data source extension for Power Query. The tutorial is meant to be done sequentially – each lesson builds on the connector created in previous lessons, incrementally adding new capabilities to your connector. 

In this lesson, you will:

* Enforce a table schema using [M Types](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt809131.aspx)
* Set types for nested records and lists
* Dynamically calculate types from an external source 

In the previous lesson we defined our table schemas using a simple "Schema Table" system.
This schema table approach works for many REST APIs/Data Connectors, but services that return complete
or deeply nested data sets might benefit from the approach in this tutorial, which leverages 
the [M type system](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt809131.aspx).

This lesson will guide you through the following steps:

1. Defining custom M types
2. Enforcing a schema using types
3. Adding unit tests to your project
4. Reading schema/metadata from an external source
5. Dynamically constructing custom types
