# TripPin Part 7 - Advanced Schema with M Types

This multi-part tutorial covers the creation of a new data source extension for Power Query. The tutorial is meant to be done sequentially ï¿½ each lesson builds on the connector created in previous lessons, incrementally adding new capabilities to your connector. 

In this lesson, you will:

* Enforce a table schema using [M Types](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt809131.aspx)
* Set types for nested records and lists
* Refactor code for reuse and unit testing
