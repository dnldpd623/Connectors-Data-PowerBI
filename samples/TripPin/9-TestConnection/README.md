# TripPin Part 9 - TestConnection

This multi-part tutorial covers the creation of a new data source extension for Power Query. The tutorial is meant to be done sequentially - each lesson builds on the connector created in previous lessons, incrementally adding new capabilities to your connector.

In this lesson, you will:

* Add a TestConnection handler
* Configure the Power BI On-Premises Data Gateway (Personal mode)
* Test scheduled refresh through the Power BI service

Please follow the tutorial at Microsoft Docs for Power Query [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/samples/trippin/9-testconnection/readme).
