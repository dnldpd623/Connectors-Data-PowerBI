# Enabling Direct Query for an ODBC based connector

## Overview

Using M's built-in [Odbc.DataSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt708843) function is the recommended way to
create custom connectors for data sources that have an existing ODBC
driver and/or support a SQL query syntax. Wrapping the [Odbc.DataSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt708843)
function will allow your connector to inherit default query folding
behavior based on the capabilities reported by your driver. This will
enable the M engine to generate SQL statements based on filters and
other transformations defined by the user within the Power Query
experience, without having to provide this logic within the connector
itself.

ODBC extensions can optionally enable Direct Query mode, allowing Power
BI to dynamically generate queries at runtime without pre-caching the
user's data model.

Note: Enabling Direct Query support raises the difficulty and complexity
level of your connector. When Direct Query is enabled, Power BI will
prevent the M engine from compensating for operations that cannot be
fully pushed to the underlying data source.

This document builds on the concepts presented in the M Extensibility
Reference, and assumes familiarity with the creation of a basic Data
Connector.

Please refer to the [SqlODBC
sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/DataConnectors/tree/master/samples/ODBC/SqlODBC)
for most of the code examples in the sections below. Additional samples
can be found in the ODBC samples directory.

## ODBC Extensibility Functions

The M engine provides two ODBC related data source functions:
[Odbc.DataSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt708843), and [Odbc.Query](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt260873).

The [Odbc.DataSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt708843) function provides a default navigation table with
all databases, tables, and views from your system, supports query
folding, and allows for a range of customization options. The majority
of ODBC based extensions will use this as their primary extensibility
function. The function accepts two arguments -- a connection string, and
an options record to provide behavior overrides.

The [Odbc.Query](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt260873) function allows you to execute SQL statements through an
ODBC driver. It acts as a passthrough for query execution. Unlike the
[Odbc.DataSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt708843) function, it does not provide query folding
functionality, and requires that SQL queries be provided by the
connector (or end user). When building a custom connector, this function
is typically used internally to run queries to retrieve metadata that
might not be exposed through regular ODBC channels. The function accepts
two arguments -- a connection string, and a sql query.

## Parameters for your Data Source Function

Custom connectors can accept any number of function arguments, but to
remain consistent with the built-in data source functions shipped with
Power Query, the following guidelines are recommended:

  - Require the minimal set of parameters used to establish a connection
    to your server. The less parameters end users need to provide, the
    easier your connector will be to use.

  - Although you can define parameters with a fixed number of values
    (i.e. dropdown list in the UI), parameters are entered before the
    user is authenticated. Any values that can be discovered
    programmatically after the user is authenticated (such as catalog or
    database name) should be selectable through the Navigator. The
    default behavior for the [Odbc.DataSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt708843) function will be to return
    a hierarchical navigation table consisting of Catalog (Database),
    Schema, and Table names, although this can be overridden within your
    connector.

  - If you feel your users will typically know what values to enter for
    items they would select from the Navigator (such as the database
    name), make these parameters optional. Parameters that can be
    discovered programmatically should not be made required.

  - The last parameter for your function should be an optional record
    called "options". This parameter typically allows advanced users to
    set common ODBC related properties (such as CommandTimeout), set
    behavior overrides specific to your connector, and allows for future
    extensibility without impacting backwards compatibility for your
    function.

  - Security/credential related arguments MUST never be part of your
    data source function parameters, as values entered in the connect
    dialog will be persisted to the user's query. Credential related
    parameters should be specified as part of the connector's supported
    Authentication methods.

By default, all required parameters for your data source function are
factored into Data Source Path value used to identify user credentials.

Note that while the UI for the built-in [Odbc.DataSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt708843) function
provides a dropdown that allows the user to select a DSN, this
functionality is not available via extensibility. If your data source
configuration is complex enough to require a fully customizable
configuration dialog, it is recommended you require your end users to
pre-configure a system DSN, and have your function take in the DSN name
as a text field.

## Parameters for Odbc.DataSource

The [Odbc.DataSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt708843) function takes two parameters -- a connectionString
for your driver, and an options record which lets your override various
driver behaviors. Through the options record you can override
capabilities and other information reported by the driver, control the
navigator behavior, and affect the SQL queries generated by the M
engine.

The supported options records fields fall into two categories -- those
that are public / always available, and those that are only available in
an extensibility context.

The following table describes the public fields in the options record.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Field</th>

### Overriding AstVisitor

The AstVisitor field is set through the [Odbc.DataSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt708843) options record.
It is used to modify SQL statements generated for specific query
scenarios. Providing an override for this value has been deprecated and may be removed from future implementations.

#### Constant

No documentation available.

#### LimitClause

This functionality has been replaced by the LimitClauseKind option of SqlCapabilities; see that section for more information. The
following is the original documentation for the LimitClause field.

This field is a function that receives two `Int64.Type` arguments (skip,
take), and returns a record with two text fields (Text, Location).

```
LimitClause = (skip as nullable number, take as number) as record => ...
```

The skip parameter is the number of rows to skip (i.e. the argument to
OFFSET). If an offset is not specified, the skip value will be null. If
your driver supports `LIMIT`, but does not support `OFFSET`, the LimitClause
function should return an unimplemented error (...) when skip is greater
than 0.

The take parameter is the number of rows to take (i.e. the argument to
LIMIT).

The `Text` field of the result contains the SQL text to add to the
generated query.

The `Location` field specifies where to insert the clause. The following
table describes supported values.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>AfterQuerySpecification</td>
<td><p>LIMIT clause is put at the end of the generated SQL.</p>
<p>This is the most commonly supported LIMIT syntax.</p></td>
<td><p>SELECT a, b, c</p>
<p>FROM table</p>
<p>WHERE a &gt; 10</p>
<p><strong>LIMIT 5</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>BeforeQuerySpecification</td>
<td>LIMIT clause is put before the generated SQL statement.</td>
<td><p><strong>LIMIT 5 ROWS</strong></p>
<p>SELECT a, b, c</p>
<p>FROM table</p>
<p>WHERE a &gt; 10</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>AfterSelect</td>
<td>LIMIT goes after the SELECT statement, and after any modifiers (such as DISTINCT).</td>
<td><p>SELECT DISTINCT <strong>LIMIT 5</strong> a, b, c</p>
<p>FROM table</p>
<p>WHERE a &gt; 10</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>AfterSelectBeforeModifiers</td>
<td>LIMIT goes after the SELECT statement, but before any modifiers (such as DISTINCT).</td>
<td><p>SELECT <strong>LIMIT 5</strong> DISTINCT a, b, c</p>
<p>FROM table</p>
<p>WHERE a &gt; 10</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The following code snippet provides a LimitClause implementation for a
driver that expects a LIMIT clause, with an optional OFFSET, in the
following format: `[OFFSET <offset> ROWS] LIMIT <row_count>`

```
LimitClause = (skip, take) =>
    let
        offset = if (skip > 0) then Text.Format("OFFSET #{0} ROWS", {skip}) else "",
        limit = if (take <> null) then Text.Format("LIMIT #{0}", {take}) else ""
    in
        [
            Text = Text.Format("#{0} #{1}", {offset, limit}),
            Location = "AfterQuerySpecification"
        ]
```

The following code snippet provides a LimitClause implementation for a
driver that supports LIMIT, but not OFFSET. Format: `LIMIT <row_count>`.

```
LimitClause = (skip, take) =>
    if (skip > 0) then error "Skip/Offset not supported"
    else if (take <> null) then
    [
        Text = Text.Format("LIMIT #{0}", {take}),
        Location = "AfterQuerySpecification"
    ]
    else ""
```

### Overriding SQLColumns

`SQLColumns` is a function handler that receives the results of an ODBC call
to [SQLColumns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/syntax/sqlcolumns-function). The source parameter contains a table with the data type information. This override is typically used to fix up data type mismatches between calls to `SQLGetTypeInfo` and `SQLColumns`.

For details of the format of the source table parameter, please see:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/syntax/sqlcolumns-function

### Overriding SQLGetFunctions

This field is used to override SQLFunctions values returned by an ODBC
driver. It contains a record whose field names are equal to the
FunctionId constants defined for the ODBC
[SQLGetFunctions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/syntax/sqlgetfunctions-function)
function. Numeric constants for each of these fields can be found in the
[ODBC
specification](https://github.com/Microsoft/ODBC-Specification/blob/master/Windows/inc/sqlext.h).

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Field</th>
<th>Details</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>SQL_CONVERT_FUNCTIONS</td>
<td>Indicates which function(s) are supported when doing type conversions. By default, the M Engine will attempt to use the CONVERT function. Drivers that prefer the use of CAST can override this value to report that only SQL_FN_CVT_CAST (numeric value of 0x2) is supported.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>SQL_API_SQLBINDCOL</td>
<td><p>A logical (true/false) value that indicates whether the Mashup Engine should use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/syntax/sqlbindcol-function">SQLBindCol API</a> when retrieving data.

<p>Default: false</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The following code snippet provides an example explicitly telling the M
engine to use CAST rather than CONVERT.

```
SQLGetFunctions = [
    SQL_CONVERT_FUNCTIONS = 0x2 /* SQL_FN_CVT_CAST */
]
```

### Overriding SQLGetInfo

This field is used to override SQLGetInfo values returned by an ODBC
driver. It contains a record whose fields are names are equal to the
InfoType constants defined for the ODBC
[SQLGetInfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/syntax/sqlgetinfo-function)
function. Numeric constants for each of these fields can be found in the
[ODBC
specification](https://github.com/Microsoft/ODBC-Specification/blob/master/Windows/inc/sqlext.h).
The full list of InfoTypes that are checked can be found in the Mashup
Engine trace files.

The following table contains commonly overridden SQLGetInfo properties:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Field</th>

<p>(4) SQL_SC_ SQL92_INTERMEDIATE = Intermediate level SQL-92 compliant.</p>
<p>(8) SQL_SC_SQL92_FULL = Full level SQL-92 compliant.</p>
<p>Note that in Power Query scenarios, the connector will be used in a Read Only mode. Most drivers will want to report a SQL_SC_SQL92_FULL compliance level, and override specific SQL generation behavior using the SQLGetInfo and SQLGetFunctions properties.</p></td>

<p>SQL_GB_GROUP_BY_EQUALS_SELECT = The GROUP BY clause must contain all non-aggregated columns in the select list. It cannot contain any other columns. For example, SELECT DEPT, MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY DEPT.</p>
<p>SQL_GB_GROUP_BY_CONTAINS_SELECT = The GROUP BY clause must contain all non-aggregated columns in the select list. It can contain columns that are not in the select list. For example, SELECT DEPT, MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY DEPT, AGE.</p>
<p>SQL_GB_NO_RELATION = The columns in the GROUP BY clause and the select list are not related. The meaning of non-grouped, non-aggregated columns in the select list is data source–dependent. For example, SELECT DEPT, SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY DEPT, AGE.</p>

The following helper function can be used to create bitmask values from
a list of integer
values:

```
Flags = (flags as list) =>
    let
        Loop = List.Generate(
                  ()=> [i = 0, Combined = 0],
                  each [i] < List.Count(flags),
                  each [i = [i]+1, Combined =*Number.BitwiseOr([Combined], flags{i})],
                  each [Combined]),
        Result = List.Last(Loop, 0)
    in
        Result;
```

### Overriding SQLGetTypeInfo

`SQLGetTypeInfo` can be specified in two ways:

1. A fixed `table` value that contains the same type information as an ODBC call to `SQLGetTypeInfo`
2. A function that accepts a table argument, and returns a table. The argument will contain the original results of the ODBC call to `SQLGetTypeInfo`. Your function implementation can modify/add to this table.

The first approach is used to completely override the values returned by the ODBC driver. The second approach is used if you want to add to or modify these values.

For details of the format of the types table parameter and expected return value,
please see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/syntax/sqlgettypeinfo-function

#### SQLGetTypeInfo using a static table

The following code snippet provides a static implementation for SQLGetTypeInfo.

```

### Overriding SQLTables

**TODO**

## Creating Your Connector

**Checklist: TODO**

### Setting the Connection String

The connection string for your ODBC driver is set using the first
argument to the [Odbc.DataSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt708843) and/or [Odbc.Query](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt260873) functions. The value
can be text, or an M record. When using the record, each field in the
record will become a property in the connection string. All connection
strings will require a Driver field (or DSN field if you require users
to pre-configure a system level DSN). Credential related properties will
be set separately (see below). Other properties will be driver specific.

The code snippet below shows the definition of a new data source
function, creation of the ConnectionString record, and invocation of the
[Odbc.DataSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt708843) function.

```
[DataSource.Kind="SqlODBC", Publish="SqlODBC.Publish"]
shared SqlODBC.Contents = (server as text) =>
    let
        ConnectionString = [
            Driver = "SQL Server Native Client 11.0",
            Server = server,
            MultiSubnetFailover = "Yes",
            ApplicationIntent = "ReadOnly",
            APP = "PowerBICustomConnector"
        ],
        OdbcDatasource = Odbc.DataSource(ConnectionString)
    in
        OdbcDatasource;
```

## Troubleshooting and Testing

**To enable tracing in Power BI Desktop:**

1. Go to File | Options and settings | Options
2. Click on the **Diagnostics** tab
3. Click the **Enable tracing** option
4. Click the **Open traces folder** link (should be `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Microsoft/Power BI Desktop/Traces`)
5. Delete existing trace files
6. Perform your tests
7. Close Power BI Desktop to ensure all log files are flushed to disk

Here are steps you can take for initial testing in Power BI Desktop:

1. Close Power BI Desktop
2. Clear your trace directory
3. Open Power BI desktop, and enable tracing
4. Connect to your data source, and select Direct Query mode
5. Select a table in the navigator, and click Edit
6. Manipulate the query in various ways, including:
>*  Take the First N rows (i.e. 10)
>*  Set equality filters on different data types (int, string, bool, etc)
>*  Set other range filters (greater than, less than)
>*  Filter on NULL / NOT NULL
>*  Select a sub-set of columns
>*  Aggregate / Group By different column combinations
>*  Add a column calculated from other columns ([C] = [A] + [B])
>* Sort on one column, multiple columns
7. Expressions that fail to fold will result in a warning bar. Note the
    failure, remove the step, and move to the next test case. Details
    about the cause of the failure should be emitted to the trace logs.
8. Close Power BI Desktop
9. Copy the trace files to a new directory
10. Use the recommend Power BI workbook to parse and analyze the trace files

Once you have simple queries working, you can then try Direct Query
scenarios (i.e. building reports in the Report Views). The queries
generated in Direct Query mode will be significantly more complex (i.e.
use of sub-selects, COALESCE statements, and aggregations).

## Common Problems

**TODO**

- In query editor, filter on each data type
- Filter on missing data types -- SEARCHABLE
- Filter on date -- timestamp precision incorrect

### Concatenation of strings in Direct Query mode

The M engine does basic type size limit validation as part of its query folding logic. If you are receiving a folding error when trying to concatenate two strings that potentially overflow the maximum size of the underlying database type:

1. Ensure that your database can support up-conversion to CLOB types when string concat overflow occurs
2. Set the `TolerateConcatOverflow` [option]((#parameters-for-odbcdatasource)) for Odbc.DataSource to `true`

> The [DAX CONCATENATE function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/query-bi/dax/concatenate-function-dax) is currently not supported by Power Query/ODBC extensions.
> Extension authors should ensure string concatenation works through the query editor by adding calculated columns (`[stringCol1] & [stringCol2]`).
> When the capability to fold the CONCATENATE operation is added in the future, it should work seamlessly with existing extensions.
